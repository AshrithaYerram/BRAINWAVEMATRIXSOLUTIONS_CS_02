algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.

This repo contains a Python code for checking the strength of password. It analysis the password and return how strong the password is based of the length, complexity and presence of certain character. It also check if the password is in a list of frequently used password, Use this tool to determine how strong and secure your password is

Introduction to Password Strength Checker


In today's digital world, securing online accounts is more important than ever. A password strength checker is a tool designed to assess the security of a password and provide feedback on how to improve it. Weak passwords are a major risk, as they can be easily guessed or cracked by hackers using techniques like brute force attacks and dictionary attacks.

A strong password should be long, complex, and unique. It should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, while avoiding common words or easily guessable information. A password strength checker evaluates these factors and assigns a security rating, helping users create more secure passwords to protect their accounts from cyber threats.
